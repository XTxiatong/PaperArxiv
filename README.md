# Predictive Uncertainty
Estimating the uncertainty of deep learning models has gained more interests recent years, mainly due to the safty concerns for real applications. 
In this Arxiv, latest literature from NIPS, ICML, ICLR, etc will be covered (on-updating). 
(some papers may be included multiple times if they cover across topics.)

## Survey:


## Dataset and Benchmarking:


## Bayesian Deep Learning:


## Out-of-distribution Detection: 



## Non-parametric Gaussian Process:

## Evidential Network

Instead of estimiating the distribition on weights, i.e., Beyasian learsning, evidential deep learning is to find the distribution over predictors. \
Assume that what we obatin from a nueral network is not the categorical probability *P*, but a distribution *u* over *P*. \
Note: If the prior of the distribution is Dirichlet, then the posterior is still Dirichlet because Mulitnomial is congugated to that. \
